# Clinic Growth OS — Advertising Operating System
## Complete Build Plan

---

## PRODUCT VISION

**One sentence:** The tool that makes it almost impossible for clinics to fail with their advertising.

**The gap:** Kong does creatives. Lovart does images. AdCreative does copy. Nobody holds a clinic owner's hand from "I have a service" all the way through "I'm scaling at $15 CPL and know exactly why."

**5 Modules:**
1. **Offer Intelligence Engine** — Score, fix, and optimize offers before spending a dollar
2. **Avatar & Creative Factory** — Generate 50+ ads with images at scale (Lovart-style batch generation)
3. **Campaign Architect** — IKEA-instructions for Facebook Ads Manager setup
4. **Metrics Command Center + AI Ad Coach** — Daily pulse, weekly briefs, proactive alerts, chat coach
5. **Iteration Engine** — Auto-generate winner variations, diagnose losers, never stop improving

---

## PHASE 0: VALIDATE INTEGRATIONS (Days 1–2)

**Goal:** Confirm every external dependency works before writing a line of code.

### Checklist

| Check | Action | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Database schema** | Finalize tables: `offers`, `campaigns`, `avatars`, `creatives`, `metrics`, `iterations`, `coaching_sessions` | ☐ |
| **Anthropic API** | Confirm API key, test structured JSON output with Claude Sonnet | ☐ |
| **Image Generation API** | Choose provider: Replicate (Flux), DALL-E 3, or Stability AI. Verify API keys, test batch generation, confirm rate limits | ☐ |

| **Web scraping** | Test competitor research capability (Apify or direct scraping for local clinic offers) | ☐ |

### Deliverable
One document: **Integration Map** — every external connection with endpoint, credentials location, rate limits, and fallback plan.

---

## PHASE 1: CONTEXT LAYER (Days 3–7)

**Goal:** Build the knowledge base that makes every AI output healthcare-specific, not generic.

These are the reference documents the AI uses as context when generating outputs. This is your competitive moat — generic tools use generic prompts. Your tool uses battle-tested healthcare advertising frameworks.

### Files to Create

| File | Purpose | Source |
|------|---------|--------|
| `context/healthcare_offer_frameworks.md` | Proven offer structures for clinics: risk reversal patterns, guarantee frameworks, urgency triggers, pricing psychology for healthcare | Your existing client work + research |
| `context/hyperdopamine_frameworks.md` | The 5 ad style frameworks (Breaking News, Pattern Interrupt, Native Highlight, Native Social Post, Revealed/Location) with full templates | Your `hyperdopamine-ad-master-template.md` — already done |
| `context/ad_copy_formulas.md` | The 5 copy formulas (Story Arc, Revelation, Before/After Bridge, Calculator, Text Message) with healthcare examples | Your `ad-copy-master.md` — already done |
| `context/healthcare_cpl_benchmarks.md` | CPL ranges by vertical: med spa ($15-45), dental ($20-60), IV therapy ($12-35), weight loss ($18-50), wellness ($15-40). Include CTR benchmarks, frequency thresholds, ROAS targets | Your client data + industry research |
| `context/avatar_libraries.md` | Complete avatar libraries by vertical: med spa (7 avatars), dental (6), IV therapy (8), B2B/AI (6), fitness (6). Each with situation, 3 emotions, 3 hooks | Your master template — already done |
| `context/campaign_structure_templates.md` | Facebook Ads campaign structures: avatar test structure, emotion test structure, style test structure. Budget allocation formulas, kill criteria, scale criteria | Your methodology |
| `context/metrics_interpretation_rules.md` | Decision rules: "If CPL > benchmark by 50% after 3 days and 1000+ impressions, kill." "If frequency > 3.0, rotate creative." "If CTR < 1% after 500 impressions, the hook is weak." | Your advertising experience |
| `context/competitor_analysis_framework.md` | How to analyze competitor offers: what to look for in their ads, landing pages, pricing, guarantees, positioning | Your research methodology |

### Why This Matters
Without these context files, the AI generates generic marketing advice. With them, it generates advice that sounds like YOU — the Doctor Lead Flow methodology. Every prompt in Phase 2 references these context files.

---

## PHASE 2: HARD PROMPTS (Days 8–12)

**Goal:** Define every AI task with explicit input/output schemas. No ambiguity.

Each "hard prompt" is a structured template that takes specific inputs and produces specific outputs in JSON format. These become the backbone of every tool in Phase 3.

| `prompts/ad_coach_chat.md` | `{ user_message, clinic_context, campaign_data, conversation_history }` | `{ response, data_referenced, confidence_level, follow_up_questions }` |
| `prompts/proactive_alert.md` | `{ trigger_type, metric_data, thresholds }` | `{ alert_title, severity, explanation, recommended_action, one_click_action }` |

### Module 5: Iteration Engine

---

## PHASE 3: TOOLS (Days 13–34, ~3 weeks)

**Goal:** Build every tool. Reuse existing infrastructure first, create only what's missing.

### Module 1 Tools: Offer Intelligence

| Tool | Type | Implementation Notes |
|------|------|---------------------|
| `tools/offer_scorer.py` | **Create** | Deterministic scoring logic (check for risk reversal presence, specificity, urgency, price anchoring) + LLM interpretation using `offer_scoring.md` prompt. Score is 60% deterministic, 40% LLM assessment. |
| `tools/competitor_researcher.py` | **Extend** | Use Apify or extend existing scraper. Input: location + service type. Scrape Google Maps listings, Facebook Ad Library for competitors in same area. Extract: offer text, pricing signals, ad creative patterns. |
| `tools/offer_rewriter.py` | **Create** | Takes scored offer + weaknesses → calls LLM with `offer_variations.md` prompt → returns 3-5 ranked alternatives. Uses healthcare_offer_frameworks.md as context. |

### Module 2 Tools: Creative Factory

| Tool | Type | Implementation Notes |
|------|------|---------------------|
| `tools/avatar_generator.py` | **Create** | LLM call with `avatar_generation.md` prompt + `avatar_libraries.md` context. Generates 5-8 avatars. Stores in database with full emotional mapping. |
| `tools/copy_generator.py` | **Extend** | Based on existing script_generator pattern. Takes avatar + emotion + style → generates ad copy using `creative_copy.md` prompt + `ad_copy_formulas.md` context. Batch mode: generate for all avatar/emotion/style combinations. |
| `tools/image_prompt_generator.py` | **Create** | Takes creative data → generates detailed image prompts using `image_prompt.md` prompt + `hyperdopamine_frameworks.md` context. Output includes negative_prompt, text_overlay_positions. |
| `tools/image_batch_generator.py` | **Create** | Direct API integration with chosen provider (Replicate/DALL-E/Stability). **Key feature: batch generation with dropdown selector (1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 25 images at a time).** Queue system: submit batch → poll for completion → store results. Rate limiting built in. |
| `tools/testing_matrix_generator.py` | **Create** | Takes all creatives → organizes into 3-phase testing structure using `testing_matrix.md` prompt. Phase 1: avatar test. Phase 2: emotion test within winner. Phase 3: style test within winner. Includes budget allocation and kill/scale criteria. |

### Module 3 Tools: Campaign Architect

| Tool | Type | Implementation Notes |
|------|------|---------------------|
| `tools/campaign_blueprint_generator.py` | **Create** | Deterministic campaign structure (naming conventions, budget splits) + LLM audience mapping using `campaign_structure.md` prompt. Output: complete JSON blueprint ready for Facebook Ads API or manual setup. |
| `tools/deployment_guide_generator.py` | **Create** | Takes blueprint → generates step-by-step deployment checklist using `deployment_checklist.md` prompt. Export as PDF with visual callouts for each Facebook Ads Manager screen. |
| `tools/facebook_ads_exporter.py` | **Create** | Takes blueprint → generates Facebook Ads Manager bulk import CSV + ZIP of creative assets. Proper naming convention: `{campaign}_{avatar}_{emotion}_{style}_{variation}`. |

### Module 4 Tools: Metrics Coach

| Tool | Type | Implementation Notes |
|------|------|---------------------|
| `tools/metrics_analyzer.py` | **Create** | Core deterministic logic: pull metrics from Facebook Ads API (or manual input), calculate CPL, CTR, frequency, ROAS, CPC. Compare against benchmarks from `healthcare_cpl_benchmarks.md`. Flag anomalies. Pure code — no LLM needed for the math. |
| `tools/daily_pulse.py` | **Create** | Calls `metrics_analyzer.py` → feeds results to LLM with `daily_pulse.md` prompt → generates natural language daily summary with specific actions. Triggered by n8n cron at 6am. |
| `tools/weekly_brief.py` | **Create** | Calls `metrics_analyzer.py` for 7-day window → feeds to LLM with `weekly_brief.md` prompt → generates comprehensive weekly report with next-week plan. Triggered by n8n cron Monday 8am. |
| `tools/ad_coach_chat.py` | **Create** | Conversational AI using `ad_coach_chat.md` prompt. Context: clinic info from memory, campaign data from metrics_analyzer, conversation history. This is the "Ask Your Ad Coach" feature. Responds to natural language questions about their campaigns. |
| `tools/proactive_alerter.py` | **Create** | Runs after every metrics pull. Checks: frequency > 3.0? CPL > benchmark by 50%? No check-in > 4 days? CTR dropped > 30% day-over-day? Triggers LLM with `proactive_alert.md` prompt → sends notification via GoHighLevel SMS/email or in-app. |

### Module 5 Tools: Iteration Engine

| Tool | Type | Implementation Notes |
|------|------|---------------------|
| `tools/winner_variation_generator.py` | **Create** | Takes winning creative + performance data → generates 5 variations using `winner_variation.md` prompt. Variations: same avatar/different hook, same hook/different image style, longer vs shorter copy, different CTA, different emotion within same avatar. |
| `tools/loser_diagnosis.py` | **Create** | Takes failing creative + metrics → diagnoses failure point using `loser_diagnosis.md` prompt. Identifies whether the hook, copy, image, targeting, or offer is the problem. Suggests specific fixes with new creative drafts. |
| `tools/ab_test_recommender.py` | **Create** | After iteration, recommends the next test to run based on the testing hierarchy: avatar → emotion → style → hook → copy length → CTA. Prevents random testing and enforces systematic optimization. |

### Integration Tool (Spans All Modules)

| Tool | Type | Implementation Notes |
|------|------|---------------------|
| `tools/command_center_integration.py` | **Extend** | Add schemas for: offers (score, variations, status), creatives (copy, image, approval status), campaigns (structure, deployment status), metrics (daily snapshots), iterations (winner/loser tracking). Wire all module outputs to Command Center for unified view. |

---

## WEBINAR DEMO STRATEGY

You don't need all 5 modules built to demo. Here's the webinar-ready subset:

### Demo Build (Week 1–2, parallel to Phase 0–1)

Build a standalone Next.js demo app (the Clinic Growth OS from earlier) that showcases:

1. **Module 1 demo**: Input an offer → get a score + 3 better versions (single AI call, no competitor scraping needed for demo)
2. **Module 2 demo**: Generate 15-20 ad creatives with copy + image prompts (already built)
3. **Module 4 teaser**: Show a pre-built example of a daily pulse and weekly brief (static data, beautiful UI)
4. **Module 3 + 5 teaser**: Screenshots or "coming soon" cards

### Demo Script (for webinar)

1. "Let me show you what happens when a clinic owner brings us a weak offer..." → Run Module 1 live
2. "Now watch what happens when we feed this optimized offer into our creative engine..." → Run Module 2 live
3. "In 47 seconds, we just generated what would take a media buyer 2 weeks and $3,000..." → Show results
4. "But here's the part that really makes it impossible to fail..." → Show Module 4 coaching UI
5. "Every morning, you wake up to this..." → Show daily pulse example
6. "And when an ad starts winning, the system automatically..." → Show iteration example

---

## CRITICAL PATH DEPENDENCIES

```
Offer Intelligence (M1) → feeds into → Creative Factory (M2)
                                              ↓
                                    Campaign Architect (M3)
                                              ↓
                                    Metrics Coach (M4) ←→ Iteration Engine (M5)
                                              ↑                    ↓
                                         Facebook Ads API    Back to M2 (new creatives)
```

**Build order matters:**
- M1 and M2 can be built in parallel
- M3 depends on M2 output (needs creatives to build blueprints)
- M4 depends on M3 (needs deployed campaigns to analyze)
- M5 depends on M4 (needs performance data to identify winners/losers)
- But M5 feeds back into M2 (creates new creatives), closing the loop

---

## PRICING FRAMEWORK (for later)

| Tier | Price | Modules | Limit |
|------|-------|---------|-------|
| **Starter** | $97/mo | M1 + M2 (offer scoring + creative generation) | 3 campaigns/mo, 50 creatives/mo |
| **Growth** | $297/mo | M1 + M2 + M3 + M4 (full system minus iteration) | 10 campaigns/mo, 200 creatives/mo, daily coaching |
| **Scale** | $597/mo | All 5 modules | Unlimited campaigns, unlimited creatives, priority generation, white-glove onboarding |
| **Agency** | $1,497/mo | All 5 modules + multi-client | 25 client accounts, team seats, white-label reports |

**Positioning:** "You're paying a media buyer $2,000-5,000/month to do what this system does in 30 minutes. And the system never takes a day off."

## NEXT STEPS (This Week)

1. ☐ Validate all API integrations (Phase 0)
2. ☐ Build webinar demo app in Claude Code (parallel track)
3. ☐ Start context files — healthcare_offer_frameworks.md and healthcare_cpl_benchmarks.md are highest priority
4. ☐ Write first 3 hard prompts: offer_scoring, avatar_generation, creative_copy
5. ☐ Test image batch generation with chosen provider (Replicate recommended for cost/speed)
