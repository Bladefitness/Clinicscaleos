DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
This must feel like Stripe's dashboard meets Apple's minimalism. Premium SaaS aesthetic.

Design tokens:

Background: slate-50 (#f8fafc)
Cards: white with border-slate-200, rounded-2xl, shadow-sm, hover:shadow-md
Primary accent: emerald-500 to teal-600 gradient
Text: slate-900 (headings), slate-500 (secondary), slate-400 (muted)
Font: DM Sans — weights 400, 500, 600, 700
Border radius: rounded-xl for inputs, rounded-2xl for cards
Inputs: bg-slate-50, border-slate-200, focus:ring-emerald-500/20
Design rules:

Generous whitespace everywhere — padding 6-10 on containers
No clutter. Breathing room between elements
Subtle hover transitions (duration-200 or 300)
Cards have thin 1px borders, not heavy shadows
Small text uses tracking-wide or tracking-wider uppercase for labels
Badges are small pills: text-[10px] or text-xs, px-2, rounded-md or rounded-full
Animations should feel smooth and intentional, not flashy
SIDEBAR
Dark sidebar (bg-slate-950) with:

Logo area: "Clinic Growth OS" with a small gradient icon (emerald-to-teal, Zap icon inside)
Subtitle: "by Doctor Lead Flow" in tiny uppercase slate-400 text
Nav items:
Dashboard (LayoutDashboard icon)
AI Ad Creative Factory (Sparkles icon) — with "NEW" emerald badge
Cash Injection Generator (DollarSign icon)
ROI Calculator (Calculator icon)
Resource Vault (BookOpen icon)
Active state: bg-emerald-600/20, text-emerald-400
Inactive: text-slate-400, hover:text-white, hover:bg-slate-800/50
Bottom: user avatar circle with "DR" initials, "Dr. Blade", "Premium Plan"
Collapsible with hamburger menu button
Sidebar should use Next.js Link components for navigation between routes.

DASHBOARD PAGE (/dashboard)
Welcome message: "Welcome back, Dr. Blade"

Grid of 4 cards:

AI Ad Creative Factory — gradient emerald card, prominent, links to /ad-factory
Cash Injection Generator — white card, "Coming Soon" badge
ROI Calculator — white card, "Coming Soon" badge
Resource Vault — white card, "Coming Soon" badge
Below: Quick Stats section (all showing "0" or "—" for demo)

AI AD CREATIVE FACTORY (/ad-factory)
This is the main feature. 3-step wizard flow managed with React state (useState).

STEP 1 — Business Information Form
Header:

Small emerald pill badge: "AI-Powered Generation" with Sparkles icon
Title: "AI Ad Creative Factory" (text-3xl, font-bold)
Subtitle: "Enter your clinic details and our AI will generate 15–20 high-converting ad creatives in under 60 seconds."
Form in a white card (rounded-2xl, border, shadow-sm):

Clinic Type — dropdown select with these options: Med Spa, Dental Clinic, IV Therapy Clinic, Wellness Clinic, Weight Loss Clinic, Chiropractic Office, Dermatology Clinic, Physical Therapy, Other
Primary Service — text input, placeholder: "e.g., Botox injections, teeth whitening, IV vitamin drips..."
Location — text input, placeholder: "e.g., Miami, FL"
Target Audience — text input, placeholder: "e.g., Women 35-55, health-conscious professionals..."
Offer Details — textarea (3 rows), placeholder: "e.g., Free consultation + 20% off first treatment..."
Campaign Goal — 3 toggle buttons in a row: "Generate Leads", "Book Appointments", "Build Awareness". Selected state: border-emerald-500, bg-emerald-50, text-emerald-700
Required fields: Clinic Type, Service, Location, Goal (mark with red asterisk)

Submit button: Full width, emerald-600, "Generate Ad Creatives" with Sparkles + ArrowRight icons. Disabled (bg-slate-200, cursor-not-allowed) until required fields filled.

Below form: 3 trust badges in a row: "15-20 creatives per run", "Under 60 seconds", "Ready to deploy" — each with emerald CheckCircle2 icon.

STEP 2 — Loading Screen
Centered vertically. Show these elements:

Animated orb: Large (w-28 h-28) rounded-full with emerald-to-teal gradient, Sparkles icon spinning inside, pulsing scale animation, ping ring behind it

Progress bar: Slim (h-2) with emerald gradient fill that animates from 0% to 100%. Show percentage on left, "Generating..." on right.

Stage messages: 5 stages that light up sequentially:

"Analyzing your market landscape..." (Target icon)
"Building customer avatars..." (Users icon)
"Generating ad creatives..." (Sparkles icon)
"Optimizing hooks & copy..." (TrendingUp icon)
"Finalizing your creative library..." (CheckCircle2 icon)
Each stage transitions: pending (opacity-40, text-slate-300) → active (bg-slate-50, Loader2 spinning) → done (bg-emerald-50, text-emerald-700, CheckCircle2)

Stages advance every ~2.5 seconds regardless of actual API speed.

STEP 3 — Results Dashboard
Header row: Title "Your Ad Creatives" with count, plus action buttons:

"Copy All" — copies all creatives as formatted text
"Export" — downloads as .txt file with full formatting
"New Run" — resets to Step 1
Stats bar: 4 small cards in a row:

Total Creatives (FileText icon, emerald)
Avatars count (Users icon, blue)
Emotions count (Heart icon, rose)
Styles count (Palette icon, violet)
Filter bar: Horizontal pills to filter by avatar name. "All (count)" active by default. Click to filter. X button to clear.

Creative cards grid: 3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile.

Each creative card has:

Top bar: "#01" number left, emotion badge + style badge right
Emotion badges use these colors: frustration=red, hope=emerald, envy=amber, fear=purple, empowerment=blue, curiosity=cyan, urgency=orange, trust=teal
Style badges: Pattern Interrupt=violet, Native Social=sky, Breaking News=rose, Testimonial=amber, Before/After=lime, Educational=indigo, Social Proof=pink, Direct Offer=emerald
Avatar name with colored dot
Headline (font-bold, text-base)
Primary ad copy text
Hook angle in amber highlight box
Collapsible "Image Prompt" section (click to expand/collapse)
Category label (tiny, muted)
Bottom action bar: Copy Headline, Copy Copy, Copy Prompt buttons
Cards should stagger-animate in with fadeInUp + incremental delay.

API ROUTE — /api/generate (POST)
This is the server-side AI call. The API key must NEVER be exposed to the client.

Request body: { clinicType, service, location, targetAudience, offerDetails, goal }

The route makes 3 sequential calls to the Anthropic API to generate ~6 creatives per call (18 total). Each batch targets different avatar pairs.

Anthropic API call pattern:

import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

const anthropic = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY!,
});

const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  max_tokens: 4096,
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: prompt,
    },
  ],
});
Install @anthropic-ai/sdk as a dependency.

System prompt for generation:

You are an elite healthcare advertising strategist who creates high-converting Facebook and Instagram ads using avatar-based targeting, emotional hooks, and proven direct response frameworks.

Generate exactly 6 ad creatives for this clinic. Return ONLY a valid JSON array — no markdown, no explanation, no code fences.

CLINIC INFO:
- Type: {clinicType}
- Service: {service}
- Location: {location}
- Target: {targetAudience}
- Offer: {offerDetails}
- Goal: {goal}

AVATARS FOR THIS BATCH: {avatarPair}

Each object in the array must have exactly these keys:
- "id": number (1-6)
- "avatar": short avatar name (2-4 words)
- "emotion": one of: frustration, hope, envy, fear, empowerment, curiosity, urgency, trust
- "style": one of: Pattern Interrupt, Native Social, Breaking News, Testimonial, Before/After, Educational, Social Proof, Direct Offer
- "headline": compelling ad headline, max 10 words
- "primary_text": 2-3 sentences of ad copy using "you" language, 5th grade reading level, pain → solution → CTA format
- "image_prompt": detailed scene description for AI image generation (subject, environment, lighting, mood, camera angle, style)
- "hook": the opening hook angle in 5-8 words
- "category": one of: Avatar Test A, Avatar Test B, Emotion Test, Style Test

Rules:
- Use different emotion + style combinations across the 6 creatives
- Write at 5th grade reading level
- Use "you" and "your" language (never "we" or "our")
- Be specific to the clinic type and service
- Make headlines scroll-stopping
- Primary text should be 80-120 words max
- Image prompts should be detailed enough for Midjourney/DALL-E (include lighting, mood, composition)
Avatar pairs per batch:

Batch 1: "Busy Professional (35-50, high income, time-poor)" + "Aging Gracefully Seeker (45-65, appearance-conscious)"
Batch 2: "New Mom Reclaiming Herself (28-40, post-pregnancy)" + "Health-Conscious Executive (40-55, proactive wellness)"
Batch 3: "Social Media Savvy Millennial (25-38, appearance-driven)" + "Budget-Conscious Value Seeker (30-50, deal-motivated)"
Error handling:

Wrap each batch in try/catch
If JSON parsing fails, try to extract JSON array from the response using regex
If a batch fails, continue with remaining batches
If ALL batches fail, return a fallback set of 18 pre-built mock creatives
Return { creatives: Creative[], source: "ai" | "fallback" } from the endpoint
IMPORTANT: The fallback mock creatives must be realistic and customized using the form data (inject clinicType, service, location, offerDetails into the mock copy). The demo must NEVER show an error screen.

CLIENT-SIDE GENERATION FLOW
When user clicks "Generate Ad Creatives":

Set step to 2 (loading screen)
Start stage animation timer (advance every 2.5s)
Start progress bar animation (increment randomly 1-3% every 200ms, cap at 90%)
Make POST fetch to /api/generate with form data
When response arrives:
Set progress to 100%
Set final stage to "done"
Wait 800ms for visual satisfaction
Set step to 3, populate creatives
If fetch fails entirely:
Still transition to step 3 with fallback message
Never show an error screen during a live demo
ENV FILES
.env.example:

# Get your API key at https://console.anthropic.com
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
.env.local (add to .gitignore):

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
README.md
Write a clean README with:

Project name and one-line description
Screenshot placeholder
Quick start instructions (clone, npm install, add .env.local, npm run dev)
How to deploy to Vercel (push to GitHub, import in Vercel, add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var)
Tech stack list
Folder structure overview
DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
Make sure:

.env.local is in .gitignore
.env.example exists with placeholder
No API keys in client-side code
npm run build passes with zero errors
All "use client" directives are correct
No TypeScript errors
The app works on localhost:3000
CRITICAL RULES
Every component that uses useState, useEffect, onClick, or any interactivity MUST have "use client" at the top
Server components (pages that just render) should NOT have "use client"
The API route (/api/generate/route.ts) is server-side only — no "use client"
Use next/link for sidebar navigation
Use next/font/google to load DM Sans
Make the sidebar a shared layout component (put in app-shell.tsx used by all pages)
All pages should be wrapped in the app-shell layout
The ad-factory page manages its own 3-step wizard state internally
